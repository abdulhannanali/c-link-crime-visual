            <h1>How <span>SAFE</span> is SoDo?</h1>
            <p>Seattle's SoDo (South of Downtown) neighborhood gets a lot of people passing through. Average attendance for a Seahawks home game at Century Link Field was 68,412 during the 2014-2015 season, accoring to <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/249667/average-home-attendance-of-the-seattle-seahawks/">Statista</a>, and that doesn't take into account attendance at Mariners games, Sounders games, or the various concerts and events that take place at SoDo's stadiums. With such a high concentration of people, especially during events where emotions can run high and alcohol is flowing, there's bound to be some influence on crime rates. But how dangerous is the crime around Century Link and SoDo's other venues?</p>

            <p>As we can see from the chart, the most prominent category of crime around Century Link is general distubances, which includes crimes categorized as "suspicious circumstances", "nuisance and/or mischief", "car prowls", and "disturbance". The other two most common types of crimes are property crimes, which includes lost/stolen or damaged property, and automotive incidents, including traffic violations. Violent crime, threats and harassment, and weapons calls combined make up only 4.9% of incidents.</p>
            <p>Based on this breakdown, we can generalize that violent crime doesn't need to be a worry of a Seahawks game attendee, but that parking your car in a secure spot is probably something that you should make a priority. And, considering that alcohol and drug-related incidents make up 7.1% of the breakdown, make sure you don't let your partying get the best of you.</p>
